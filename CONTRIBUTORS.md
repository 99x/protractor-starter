# Commit Guidelines (Git Commit Convention)

A strict commit guidelines are followed so that its easy to do release with semantic versioning. [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) package is used to do this. [Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) is used with [Commitizen Conventional Changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-conventional-changelog) to add proper commit messages. Git hooks  created using [ghooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghooks) are inplace to enforce the commit format used in the project.
Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject. The commit message format is bellow.

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Header is mandatory and the scope is optional, But its encouraged to add a scope. Footer is also optional.
To perform a commit follow these steps

```sh
# Add the files you want to commit
$ git add <FILES_TO_COMMIT>

# Use the configured ghook
$ npm run commit
```
